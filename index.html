  is a book club. Of sorts. <br> <br>

  We meet once a month. But rather than read a book, we bring a book. Any book
  is fine: fiction, nonfiction, poetry, a play, a screenplay, or
  even a TV show. But it must be, a book to <b>be read.</b> <br><br>

  We do have a few rules. 

  <h3>1. Bring a book</h3>
  In form or in title. A book you've read - and want others to read.

  <h3>2. Bring a bread</h3>
  Plain, laminated, gluten-free, vegan, or not-even. Something to be eaten and shared.

  <h3>3. Bring a self</h3>
  As you are, as you were. A self - that listens and learns from another.
