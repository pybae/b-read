hello hello - thank you for entertaining my theatrics.

as much as this is about books and bread (which is to say, not much), this is
more an exercise in community building than anything else.

though there is much i have to figure out, the hope is to create a community. 

a community for community's sake.

<br>

in that avenue, there will likely be more structure than social things we are
used to. there will be unique, and perhaps simply weird, exercises or activities
introduced. i beg for your pardon in advance. 

to begin with, and to prompt a bit of thought, i'd like to give the following
prompt for this month's book:

A book that has shaped you

thanks - paul
